# Alex Dart's Ski Resort Tracker

## Will help you keep customers updated on runs, conditions and lifts.

Features will include:
- ski runs and their status
- lifts, their status, and line times
- a map showing lifts, runs, and times

This application will be used to keep tabs on a ski resort! It will help the operators keep 
guests informed on each of the runs, their status (open, closed, groomed, etc.), the lifts and their status (open, closed)
and even the lines you can expect at each lift (how busy it is). This would be used on the consumer end to know about
the mountain and where to ski, and by the mountain staff to keep it updated. I ski a lot personally, so I have a
huge appreciation for apps like these. They are incredibly helpful for resort staff to know when to service runs or lifts,
and for skiers to know where to go and plan their day.

The main "user" is the resort staff, keeping it updated. Consumers would only be
able to see a portion of it, to view which runs and lifts are open, and related data.

User (from a resort staff perspective) stories:

 - As a user, I want to be able to add multiple new lifts or runs to my mountain
 - As a user, I want to be able to update the status of a lift (open, closed)
 - As a user, I want to be able to update the status of a run (groomed, powder, closed, etc.)
 - As a user, I want to be able to enter the number of people in a lift line and have a wait time estimate for that lift
 - As a user, I want to be able to view the total number of open or closed runs, and what they are, and their status
