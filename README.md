# Alex Dart's Ski Resort Tracker

## Will help you stay updated on runs, conditions and lifts.

Features will include:
- ski runs and their status
- lifts, their status, and line times
- a map showing lifts, runs, and times

What will the application do?  
This application will be used to keep tabs on an imaginary ski resort, Dart Mountain. It will help the user keep 
informed on each of the runs, their status (open, closed, groomed, etc.), the lifts and their status (open, closed)
and even the lines you can expect at each lift (how busy it is). This would be used on the consumer end to know about
the mountain and where to ski, and by the mountain staff to keep it updated. I ski a lot personally, so I have a
huge appreciation for apps like these.
